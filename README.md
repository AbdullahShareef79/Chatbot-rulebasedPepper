# Chatbot-Rule-Based

This is a rule-based chatbot designed for Pepper Robot 2.9. The project leverages predefined rules and logic to enable Pepper to interact effectively in various scenarios, making it suitable for controlled conversational applications.

## Project Overview
This project implements a rule-based chatbot system for Pepper Robot. Unlike AI-driven models, this chatbot operates based on predefined rules and decision trees to ensure reliable and predictable responses. It is ideal for applications where specific responses and controlled interaction flow are required.

## Features
- **Rule-Based Conversational Flow**: Ensures predictable and consistent interactions.
- **Customizable Rules**: Modify the logic and rules to fit specific use cases.
- **Multilingual Support**: Enables conversations in multiple languages.
- **Interactive Behavior**: Includes gestures and animations for engaging user interaction.
- **Error Handling**: Built-in mechanisms to handle unrecognized inputs and guide the user back to the expected flow.

## Technologies Used
- **Pepper Robot SDK 2.9**: Provides the tools for programming and controlling Pepper.
- **Java**: Used for implementing and managing the rule-based logic.
- **Android Studio**: For developing and testing the application.
- **QiChat**: Utilized for dialogue management and conversational rules.

## How It Works
1. **Initialization**: Pepper starts the conversation and introduces the chatbot’s purpose.
2. **Rule-Based Decision Tree**: Based on user inputs, predefined rules dictate the next steps in the conversation.
3. **Interactive Feedback**: Pepper uses speech, gestures, and screen outputs to engage with the user.
4. **End Interaction**: Concludes the session with a summary or relevant output based on the interaction.

## Setup Instructions
### Prerequisites
- Pepper Robot 2.9 with a functional network connection.
- Android Studio installed with Kotlin support.
- Java JDK 1.8.
- Pepper SDK plugins integrated into your development environment.

### Installation Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/chatbot-rule-based.git
   ```
2. Open the project in Android Studio.
3. Connect your Pepper Robot to the same network as your development machine.
4. Deploy the application to Pepper.
5. Run the application and follow the on-screen instructions to start the chatbot.

## Project Structure
- **/src**: Contains the Kotlin source code for the chatbot logic.
- **/res**: Includes resources such as layouts, strings, and drawable assets.
- **/docs**: Documentation and guides related to the project.
- **/tests**: Automated tests to ensure chatbot reliability.

## Future Enhancements
- **Dynamic Rule Updates**: Implement a feature to update rules dynamically without redeploying the application.
- **Advanced Interaction**: Add support for contextual conversations and user intent detection.
- **Analytics Dashboard**: Include logging and analytics for monitoring chatbot interactions and user behavior.
